        The entire ocean, containing 97% of Earth's water, spans 70.8% of
        Earth's surface, making it Earth's global ocean or world ocean. This
        makes Earth, along with its vibrant hydrosphere a "water world" or
        "ocean world", particularly in Earth's early history when the ocean is
        thought to have possibly covered Earth completely. The ocean's shape is
        irregular, unevenly dominating the Earth's surface. This leads to the
        distinction of the Earth's surface into a water and land hemisphere, as
        well as the division of the ocean into different oceans.
